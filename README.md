### Code Academy Berlin / Module-1 / Project-1 / Sprint-1

Requirements:

- 4 pages (Home, Registration/Reservation page, Special page, Contact)
- navigation between pages
- in the Home page you must have a title, some pictures, and text
- in the Registration/Reservation page there must be text inputs, radio and checkbox inputs, select tags and a submit button. At the bottom, you should display a list of Terms and Conditions resembling the one in the mockup
- in the Special page there must be a table displaying some data
- in the Contact page there must be an email and a map
- Of course, you are free to add as many pages and features as you like, but you should finish the minimum requirements described above first.
- Extra: Create a Confirmation Page where you will direct the user when clicking on Submit (remember to use the action attribute on the form element). 
This is a nice page to have to confirm that the data submitted has been received. 
This page could be styled according to your design and it could have a button to go back.
